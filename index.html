  Today was a good day.
  I didnt yell when i was being triggered by the sound of my children screaming because the oldest took a toy from the youngest
  I closed my eyes and tried to breath, reminding myself that they are young and it is ok.

    Today was a good day.
    I didnt feel like my world was falling apart dispite spilling my fresh cup of coffee all over the floor
     or when I wasnt understanding my assignment for school
    I managed to not feel like I was a failure and could do nothing right.

  <p>
      Today was a good day
      I was able to enjoy baby smiles and laughter
      Listen so my oldest sing all his favorite music
      I was a good mother today
