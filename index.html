  Today was a good day.
  </p>
<p>
  I didnt yell when i was being triggered by the sound of my children screaming because the oldest took a toy from the youngest
</p>
<p>
  I closed my eyes and tried to breath, reminding myself that they are young and it is ok.
</p>
<p>
    Today was a good day.
  
  <p>
    I didnt feel like my world was falling apart dispite spilling my fresh cup of coffee all over the floor
</p>
<p>
     or when I wasnt understanding my assignment for school
</p>
<p>
    I managed to not feel like I was a failure and could do nothing right.
  </p>

  <p>
      Today was a good day
</p>
<p>
      I was able to enjoy baby smiles and laughter
</p>
<p>
      Listen so my oldest sing all his favorite music
</p>
<p>
      I was a good mother today
  </p>
  <p>
    Today was a good day
